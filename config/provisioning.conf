# Support setting the initial WiFi credentials when creating MicroSD cards.
#
# Note that the '$' is escaped so that environment variable replacement happens
# when firmware is written to the MicroSD card rather than when the '.fw' file
# is created.  WiFi credentials are not stored in the .fw file. If left blank,
# the device won't connect to WiFi and you'll need to configure it in this Mix
# project or via an iex prompt.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you configure WiFi in this Mix project or via the IEx prompt,
# that configuration will be persisted and these won't be used unless
# $NERVES_WIFI_FORCE is set to "true" (or anything)
